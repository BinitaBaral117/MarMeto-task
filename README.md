HTML Structure: I have defined the structure of your webpage using HTML, including containers for different sections like Men's, Women's, and Kids' items.
CSS Styling: I have applied styles to different elements using CSS to make them visually appealing and responsive. This includes styling for buttons, item details, product display, prices, and more.
JavaScript Functionality: I have added JavaScript for dynamic functionality like fetching data for different categories of products (Men, Women, Kids) from an external JSON file, displaying those products dynamically on the webpage, and implementing a pop-up feature for product details.
External Libraries: I am using Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts for typography.


To run this code:
Save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into separate files (index.html, style.css, script.js).
Ensure that the Font Awesome and Google Fonts URLs are accessible.
Place the JSON file (multiProduct.json) containing product data at the specified URL (https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/3685/0790/files/multiProduct.json) or adjust the fetchData() function to fetch data from a different source.
Open the index.html file in a web browser manually or with Go Live extension available in VS Code.


Once the webpage loads, you should see the "MarMeto" e-commerce site with options to select Men's, Women's, or Kids' items. Clicking on any of these options will fetch and display relevant products dynamically. You can click on each product to see its details in a pop-up.
